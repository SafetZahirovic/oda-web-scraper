# Worker Thread Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Oda Web Scraper now uses **Node.js Worker Threads** for parallel processing of multiple URLs. This architecture provides significant performance improvements and better resource utilization.

## Architecture

### Main Thread (`src/index.ts`)

- **Role**: Orchestrator and result collector
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Spawns one worker per URL
  - Manages worker lifecycle
  - Collects and processes results
  - Handles exports for each URL
  - Provides summary statistics

### Worker Threads (`src/worker.ts`)

- **Role**: Individual URL processor
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages its own browser instance
  - Scrapes assigned URL completely
  - Handles all subcategories and pagination
  - Returns results to main thread

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Parallel Processing**

```typescript
// Before: Sequential processing
for (const url of URLS) {
  await processUrl(url); // One at a time
}

// After: Parallel processing
const workers = URLS.map((url) => createWorker(url));
await Promise.allSettled(workers); // All at once
```

### 2. **Resource Isolation**

- Each worker has its own browser instance
- No conflicts between different URL scraping processes
- Isolated memory spaces prevent interference

### 3. **Scalability**

- Easy to add more URLs by updating the `URLS` array
- Performance scales with available CPU cores
- No need to modify core scraping logic

### 4. **Error Resilience**

- If one worker fails, others continue processing
- Graceful error handling per worker
- Main thread collects partial results

## Implementation Details

### Worker Creation

```typescript
function createWorker(url: string, urlIndex: number): Promise<WorkerResult> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const workerPath = path.join(__dirname, "worker.js");
    const worker = new Worker(workerPath, {
      workerData: {
        url,
        urlIndex,
        totalUrls: URLS.length,
        browserConfig: BROWSER_CONFIG,
      },
    });

    worker.on("message", resolve);
    worker.on("error", reject);
  });
}
```

### Worker Data Structure

```typescript
interface WorkerData {
  url: string; // URL to scrape
  urlIndex: number; // Position in URL array
  totalUrls: number; // Total URLs being processed
  browserConfig: BrowserConfig; // Browser settings
}

interface WorkerResult {
  success: boolean; // Whether scraping succeeded
  products?: ProductData[]; // Scraped products
  error?: string; // Error message if failed
  url: string; // Original URL
  urlIndex: number; // Worker identifier
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Running the Scraper

```bash
# Build and run with workers
npm run dev

# Run with TypeScript directly
npm run dev:ts

# Demo the worker concept
npm run demo
```

### Adding More URLs

```typescript
const URLS = [
  "https://oda.com/no/categories/1135-bakeri-og-konditori/",
  "https://oda.com/no/categories/20-frukt-og-gront/",
  "https://oda.com/no/categories/123-new-category/", // Just add here!
];
```

### Expected Output

```
üöÄ Starting 3 workers for parallel scraping...

üèóÔ∏è  Worker 1: Starting web scraper for URL 1/3...
üèóÔ∏è  Worker 2: Starting web scraper for URL 2/3...
üèóÔ∏è  Worker 3: Starting web scraper for URL 3/3...

‚úÖ Worker 1: Successfully processed https://oda.com/...
‚úÖ Worker 2: Successfully processed https://oda.com/...
‚úÖ Worker 3: Successfully processed https://oda.com/...

üéâ All workers completed!
üìä Successful workers: 3/3
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `src/worker.ts` - Worker script for individual URL processing
- `demo-workers.js` - Demonstration of worker concept
- `build-and-test.sh` - Build helper script
- `WORKER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files

- `src/index.ts` - Now orchestrates workers instead of sequential processing
- `README.md` - Updated documentation
- `package.json` - Added demo script

## Performance Comparison

### Before (Sequential)

- Time = Sum of all URLs
- Resource usage: 1 browser instance
- Example: 3 URLs √ó 2 minutes = 6 minutes total

### After (Parallel Workers)

- Time = Max of any single URL
- Resource usage: N browser instances (where N = number of URLs)
- Example: 3 URLs, slowest takes 2 minutes = 2 minutes total

## Technical Notes

### Browser Configuration

Each worker receives the same browser configuration but creates its own instance:

```typescript
const BROWSER_CONFIG: BrowserConfig = {
  headless: true, // Recommended for parallel processing
  viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
};
```

### Data Structure

Products maintain the flat structure for Supabase compatibility:

```typescript
interface ProductData {
  name: string;
  price: string | null;
  brand: string | null;
  link: string | null;
  image: string | null;
  description: string | null;
  pricePerKilo: string | null;
  discount: string | null;
  category: string; // Added for grouping
}
```

### Export Strategy

Each URL gets its own export files:

- `oda-products-{category-id}.json`
- `oda-products-{category-id}.csv`

This prevents data mixing and allows for better organization.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Worker Pool**: Limit concurrent workers based on system resources
2. **Progress Reporting**: Real-time progress updates from workers
3. **Result Streaming**: Stream results as they complete instead of waiting for all
4. **Worker Recycling**: Reuse worker instances for multiple URLs
5. **Database Integration**: Direct insertion to database from workers

## Conclusion

The worker thread implementation provides:

- ‚úÖ **Significant performance improvements** through parallelization
- ‚úÖ **Better resource utilization** with isolated browser instances
- ‚úÖ **Improved scalability** for adding more URLs
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced error resilience** with isolated failure domains
- ‚úÖ **Maintained code quality** with existing testing and typing
